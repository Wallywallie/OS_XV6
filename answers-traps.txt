Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0 a1 a2
a2 holds 13

Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
26:	45b1                	li	a1,12

At what address is the function printf located?
0000000000000630

What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
0000000000000630

Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? 


The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?

In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
